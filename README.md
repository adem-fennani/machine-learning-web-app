# Stratus

A rapid prototype showcasing ML-powered student analytics and institutional decision-making tools.

## Features

### Student Portal
1. **Dropout Risk Calculator** - Assess dropout risk with personalized recommendations
2. **Program Recommender** - AI-powered program matching based on interests and goals
3. **TA Eligibility Checker** - Check teaching assistant qualification with gap analysis

### Admin Portal
4. **Financial Segmentation** - Visualize student distribution by financial groups
5. **Enrollment Forecasting** - Predict future enrollment with resource planning
6. **Performance Prediction** - Identify at-risk students and track performance

## Quick Start (Frontend)

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Quick Start (Backend)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Train models (run notebook cells for dropout)
jupyter notebook backend/notebooks/FinalModels.ipynb

# Run server
uvicorn backend/app/main:app --reload
```

## Backend Implemented Features

✅ **Success Prediction** (`/api/predict/success`)
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Input: 9 enrollment/demographic features
- Output: Success prediction, probability, confidence, factors, recommendations

## Backend Coming Soon

Once model `.pkl` files are provided:
- ⏳ Dropout Risk Prediction (KNN)
- ⏳ Financial Segmentation (K-Means)
- ⏳ Program Recommendation (XGBoost)
- ⏳ Enrollment Forecasting (Polynomial Ridge)
- ⏳ Performance Prediction (Random Forest)

## Backend: Next Steps

Each objective follows the same pattern:

1. **Add export cells to notebook** for the objective
2. **Run notebook** to generate model files
3. **Create service** (`app/services/{name}_service.py`)
4. **Create schema** (`app/schemas/{name}.py`)
5. **Create router** (`app/routers/{name}.py`)
6. **Register router** in `app/main.py`
7. **Test** with test script

### Pending Objectives:
- ⏳ Financial Segmentation (K-Means)
- ⏳ Program Recommendation (XGBoost)
- ⏳ Enrollment Forecasting (Polynomial Ridge)
- ⏳ Performance Prediction (Random Forest)
- ⏳ TA Employability (KNN/Logistic Regression)

## Backend API Endpoints

- `POST /api/predict/dropout` - Predict student dropout risk
- `POST /api/segment/financial` - Segment students by financial status
- `POST /api/recommend/program` - Recommend academic programs
- `POST /api/forecast/enrollment` - Forecast future enrollment
- `POST /api/predict/performance` - Predict academic performance
- `POST /api/classify/employability` - Classify TA employability

---

## Backend Development Notes

- All endpoints use Tunisian scoring system (0-20 scale)
- Replace mock predictions with trained ML models from notebooks
- Add trained models to `app/models/` directory
